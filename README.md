## Motivation.
I wanted to test my skills at interacting with the users local storage as well as using jquery to interact with the display


## Why this project?
I love schedules and planners. Making an interactive one sounded great

## What problem are we solving?
You can provide this link to your whole team at the office, and they can all use the link on their individual cell phones or computers to set their days.

## What I learned.
I learned how to better manipulate loops as well as interaction between jquery, javascript, html, and css.
